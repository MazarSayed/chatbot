- question : I do not have insurance. What payment options do you provide? 
  answer : |  
    We offer flexible and affordable monthly payment plans, allowing you to make small payments over the course of your invisalign treatment rather than all at once. 
    
    We also offer financing with low-to-no down payment. The decision is subject to financing application approval. 

    Additionally, you can use your FSA or HSA to pay for Invisalign treatment. We'd highly recommend you check with your administrator regarding coverage. Invisalign is usually considered an eligible expense under most HSA or FSA plans. This may help significantly reduce your out-of-pocket amount. We will be happy to provide any documentation needed for reimbursement. 

    Our team would be happy to do an evaluation and provide a more accurate cost estimate for you. Would you like to book a free consultation
