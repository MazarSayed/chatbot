    We offer flexible and affordable monthly payment plans, allowing you to make small payments over the course of your invisalign treatment rather than all at once. 
    
    We also offer financing with low-to-no down payment. The decision is subject to financing application approval. 

    Additionally, you can use your FSA or HSA to pay for Invisalign treatment. We'd highly recommend you check with your administrator regarding coverage.

- question : My teeth are crowded, can Invisalign help me?
  answer : |  
    Yes, Invisalign can help with crowded teeth. Crowding is one of the most common dental issues that Invisalign is designed to address. Here's how it works: 
    (Provide as a list)
    - Custom Aligners: Invisalign uses a series of clear, custom-made aligners that are changed approximately every one to two weeks. Each set of aligners moves your teeth incrementally to their desired position. 

    - 3D Imaging Technology: Before treatment, your dentist will use 3D imaging to create a precise treatment plan, showing how your teeth will move from start to finish. 

    - Comfort and Aesthetics: The aligners are made of smooth, BPA-free plastic, making them more comfortable than traditional braces. They are also virtually invisible, which is a significant aesthetic advantage. 

    - Treatment Time: The duration of treatment for crowded teeth can vary depending on the severity, but many cases see significant improvement within 12 to 18 months. 

    - Maintenance: You'll need to wear the aligners for most of the day (about 20-22 hours), removing them only to eat, drink (except water), brush, and floss. 

    - Post-Treatment: After achieving the desired alignment, you might need to wear retainers to ensure your teeth stay in their new positions. 

    However, the suitability of Invisalign for your specific case of crowded teeth would depend on several factors such as the extent of crowding, your oral health, and any other dental issues you might have. It's important to consult with our dentist for a personalized assessment. They can evaluate your situation and determine if Invisalign is the right solution for you or if other orthodontic treatments might be necessary.

- question : Does Invisalign hurt?
  answer : | 
    Invisalign are comfortable to wear. When you first get your aligners or when you switch to a new set, you might feel some pressure or soreness as your teeth begin to move. This is normal and usually subsides within a few days as your mouth adjusts to the aligners.

  buttons:

- question: I have bridgework on several teeth. Will Invisalign clear aligners still work? 
  answer: |
    Invisalign clear aligners are designed to move each tooth individually. Because bridgework connects two or more teeth, clear aligners may not be effective, but always check with the dentist about your specific case. 
  buttons:

- question: How is Invisalign treatment different than other teeth straightening options? 
  answer: |
    Invisalign treatment is the most advanced clear aligner system in the world. Unlike braces, Invisalign clear aligners are removable and virtually invisible. There are no wires and brackets, so you don't need to change the way you brush and floss. And, you can continue to eat all your favorite foods.  

    Also, Invisalign aligners and retainers are trimmed based on each patient's gum line to provide optimal patient comfort and aesthetics. 
  buttons:

- question: Are there any restrictions on what I can eat while in treatment? 
  answer: |
    None! Invisalign clear aligners are removable, so there are no food restrictions at all. With traditional wires and brackets, there's a long list of foods you unfortunately can't enjoy because they can damage or get stuck in your braces.
