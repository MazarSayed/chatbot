  content: "I have been scared of the dentist since I was a little girl, and my visits with Dr. Kwak are the rare moments that I’ve felt safe and well taken care of in the dentist chair. 
  Dr. Kwak is amazing. She takes the time to get everything right and you can tell she truly enjoys and takes pride in her work. 
  I had a crown done and she turned a very unpleasant situation into a great one. 
  She assured me that she was using the highest quality materials. As a lady that takes pride in my appearance, who wants to skimp on your dental treatments? 
  Definitely not me. I would recommend Brookline Progressive to anyone in search of a dentist that has any anxiety.
  My hygienist was so thoughtful and attentive. She made sure I was comfortable and well informed about everything that she was doing. 
  The office staff is helpful and pleasant - Dana A."
